- 👋 Hi, I’m @moriarity-tim
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on animal welfare projects - specifically relating to logistics
- 📫 How to reach me moriarity.t@northeastern.edu 


I work at an animal shelter and have seen that logistics are one of the biggest obstacles in saving the lives of more animals. 

If we could have a better way of recognizing when shelters have capacity to take more animals from shelters that have overflow, lives of animals that are being euthanized just due to overflow could be saved. 

This is where data science could really save the day. 

I am looking to collaborate with anyone that has a any interest in this!
